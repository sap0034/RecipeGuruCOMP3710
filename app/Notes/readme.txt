Recipe Guru App:

Recipe Guru is an application that allows a user to create new recipes and save them into different categories.
The user can upload pictures of their recipe and share the recipe with friends.


We had high hopes for this application. We started out wanting to implement a camera function for users to take pictures,
a share function for social media and text messaging, and we even tried to implement the google login feature so users could
connect the recipes to their google account. Well.... we spent a week building, designing, and trying to implement a sqlite database
that failed miserably. We found an awesome tool called Room that helps to run queries and we spent two days implementing that. We
came up with an awesome customized logo and navigation bar and drawer toggle. We learned to write queries and pull data and were
well on our way to having a google play worthy application. Thursday May 3, 2018...something went very wrong when we pulled down from github.
We worked through the night to implement as much as we could. We got most of the views back and had time to implement a few CRUD functions. Added
the phone listener back in.

TO DO:
-Fix calls to database on CRUD items
-Implement utils created
